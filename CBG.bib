abstract = {Keratin 9 was recently identified as an important component of a biomarker panel which demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy (87{\%}) for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding how a protein which is predominantly expressed in palmoplantar epidermis is implicated in AD may shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the disease. Here we use immunoassays to examine blood plasma expression patterns of Keratin 9 and its relationship to other AD-associated proteins. We correlate this with the use of an in silico analysis tool VisANT to elucidate possible pathways through which the involvement of Keratin 9 may take place. We identify possible links with Dickkopf-1, a negative regulator of the wnt pathway, and propose that the abnormal expression of Keratin 9 in AD blood and cerebrospinal fluid may be a result of blood brain barrier dysregulation and disruption of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Our findings suggest that dysregulated Keratin 9 expression is a consequence of AD pathology but, as it interacts with a broad range of proteins, it may have other, as yet uncharacterized, downstream effects which could contribute to AD onset and progression.},

abstract = {Components of the plasma proteome, particularly serum albumin, have been shown to compromise the accuracy of protein microarray technologies through non-specific binding interactions. Optimisation of array conditions is imperative to help address these problems. Here we demonstrate how modifications to array printing conditions and processing methodology can influence the reliability of data output. In particular, we demonstrate that whilst some glycerol is necessary to maintain specific binding signals, it also increases non-specific binding of albumin. Concentrations of 20{\%} glycerol in the printing buffers are therefore recommended. The findings presented here provide opportunities for increased accuracy in plasma protein detection for possible future diagnostic applications.},

abstract = {All molecular interactions that are relevant to cellular and molecular structures are electrical in nature but manifest in a rich variety of forms that each has its own range and influences on the net effect of how molecular species interact. This article outlines how electrical interactions between the protein and lipid membrane components underlie many of the activities of membrane function. Particular emphasis is placed on spatially localised behaviour in membranes involving modulation of protein activity and microdomain structure. The interactions between membrane lipids and membrane proteins together with their role within cell biology represent an enormous body of work. Broad conclusions are not easy given the complexities of the various systems and even consensus with model membrane systems containing two or three lipid types is difficult. By defining two types of broad lipid-protein interaction, respectively Type I as specific and Type II as more non-specific and focussing on the electrical interactions mostly in the extra-membrane regions it is possible to assemble broad rules or a consensus of the dominant features of the interplay between these two fundamentally important classes of membrane component. This article is part of a special issue entitled: Lipid-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) has attracted considerable attention as a potential protective or palliative agent. In vitro its free-radical scavenging antioxidant action has been widely demonstrated. In vivo, however, vitamin E treatment exhibits negligible benefits against oxidative stress. Alpha-tocopherol influences lipid ordering within biological membranes and its derivatives have been suggested to inhibit the multi-drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein. This study employs the fluorescent membrane probe Di-8-ANEPPS to investigate whether these effects are connected via influences on the membrane dipole potential (MDP), an intrinsic property of biological membranes previously demonstrated to modulate P-glycoprotein activity. Alpha-tocopherol and its non free-radical scavenging succinate analogue induced similar decreases in the MDP of phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Alpha-tocopherol succinate also reduced the MDP of T-lymphocytes subsequently decreasing the binding affinity of Saquinavir for P-glycoprotein. Additionally, alpha-tocopherol succinate demonstrated a preference for cholesterol treated (membrane microdomain enriched) cells over membrane cholesterol-depleted cells. Microdomain disruption via cholesterol depletion decreased Saquinavir affinity for P-glycoprotein, potentially implicating these structures in the influence of alpha-tocopherol succinate on P-glycoprotein. This study provides evidence of a microdomain dipole potential-dependent mechanism by which alpha-tocopherol analogues influence P-glycoprotein activity. These findings have implications for the use of alpha-tocopherol derivatives for drug delivery across biological barriers.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses an increasingly profound problem to society, yet progress toward a genuine understanding of the disease remains worryingly slow. Perhaps, the most outstanding problem with the biology of AD is the question of its mechanistic origins, that is, it remains unclear wherein the molecular failures occur that underlie the disease. We demonstrate how molecular biomarkers could help define the nature of AD in terms of the early biochemical events that correlate with disease progression. We use a novel panel of biomolecules that appears in cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. As changes in the relative abundance of these molecular markers are associated with progression to AD from mild cognitive impairment, we make the assumption that by tracking their origins we can identify the biochemical conditions that predispose their presence and consequently cause the onset of AD. We couple these protein markers with an analysis of a series of genetic factors and together this hypothesis essentially allows us to redefine AD in terms of the molecular pathways that underlie the disease.},

abstract = {Effective delivery to the retina is presently one of the most challenging areas in drug development in ophthalmology, due to anatomical barriers preventing entry of therapeutic substances. Intraocular injection is presently the only route of administration for large protein therapeutics, including the anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors Lucentis (ranibizumab) and Avastin (bevacizumab). Anti-VEGFs have revolutionised the management of age-related macular degeneration and have increasing indications for use as sight-saving therapies in diabetes and retinal vascular disease. Considerable resources have been allocated to develop non-invasive ocular drug delivery systems. It has been suggested that the anionic phospholipid binding protein annexin A5, may have a role in drug delivery. In the present study we demonstrate, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, that the presence of annexin A5 can significantly enhance uptake and transcytosis of liposomal drug carrier systems across corneal epithelial barriers. This system is employed to deliver physiologically significant concentrations of Avastin to the posterior of the rat eye (127 ng/g) and rabbit retina (18 ng/g) after topical application. Our observations provide evidence to suggest annexin A5 mediated endocytosis can enhance the delivery of associated lipidic drug delivery vehicles across biological barriers, which may have therapeutic implications.},

abstract = {Previous mass spectrometry analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has allowed the identification of a panel of molecular markers that are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The panel comprises Amyloid beta, Apolipoprotein E, Fibrinogen alpha chain precursor, Keratin type I cytoskeletal 9, Serum albumin precursor, SPARC-like 1 protein and Tetranectin. Here we report the development and implementation of immunoassays to measure the abundance and diagnostic capacity of these putative biomarkers in matched lumbar CSF and blood plasma samples taken in life from individuals confirmed at post-mortem as suffering from AD (n = 10) and from screened 'cognitively healthy' subjects (n = 18). The inflammatory components of Alzheimer's disease were also investigated. Employment of supervised learning techniques permitted examination of the interrelated expression patterns of the putative biomarkers and identified inflammatory components, resulting in biomarker panels with a diagnostic accuracy of 87.5{\%} and 86.7{\%} for the plasma and CSF datasets respectively. This is extremely important as it offers an ideal high-throughput and relatively inexpensive population screening approach. It appears possible to determine the presence or absence of AD based on our biomarker panel and it seems likely that a cheap and rapid blood test for AD is feasible.},

abstract = {The ability to target and control intermolecular interactions is crucial in the development of several different technologies. Here we offer a tool to rationally design liquid media systems that can modulate specific intermolecular interactions. This has broad implications in deciphering the nature of intermolecular forces in complex solutions and offers insight into the forces that govern both specific and nonspecific binding in a given system. Nonspecific binding still continues to be a problem when dealing with analyte detection across a range of different detection technologies. Here, we exemplify the problem of nonspecific binding on model membrane systems and when dealing with low-abundance protein detection on commercially available SPR technology. A range of different soluble reagents that target specific subclasses of intermolecular interactions have been tested and optimized to virtually eliminate nonspecific binding while leaving specific interactions unperturbed. Thiocyanate ions are used to target nonpolar interactions, and small reagents such as glycylglycylglycine are used to modulate the dielectric constant, which targets charge-charge and dipole interactions. We show that with rational design and careful modulation these reagents offer a step forward in dissecting the intermolecular forces that govern binding, alongside offering nonspecific binding elimination in detection systems.},
